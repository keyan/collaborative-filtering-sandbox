collaborative-filtering
===================
An experiment trying to play with user-based collaborative filtering. Turns out I was trying to use the data incorrectly. There aren't item ratings because items are often unique, and seller ratings were not useful because they were (almost) always 5 stars. Then I got bored and decided to drop this. Maybe I'll work on it again later, probably not.
